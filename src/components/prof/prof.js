            Remember those walls i built Well baby they're tumbling down And

            found a way to let you in But i never really had a doubt Standing in
            the light of your halo I got my angel now It's like i've been
            awakened Every rule i had you breakin It's the risk that i'm takin I
            ain't never gonna shut you out Everywhere i'm looking now I'm
            surrounded by your embrace Baby i can see your halo You know you're
            my saving grace You're everything i need and more It's written all
            over your face Baby i can feel your halo Pray it won't fade away I
            can feel your halo halo halo I can see your halo halo halo I can
            feel your halo halo halo I can see your halo halo halo Hit me like a
            ray of sun Burning through my darkest nightâ€¦
